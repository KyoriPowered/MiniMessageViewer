# MiniMessage Viewer

> It's cursed

A hacked together web based editor/viewer for MiniMessage.

--> **[Access it here](https://minidigger.github.io/CursedMessage/)** <--

This was created by copy-pasting all code from MiniMessage's new parser into this project, telling IntelliJ to convert it to Kotlin,
ripping out Adventure and replacing it with DOM calls, hacking till it compiles (**I don't know kotlin nor do I like it**) and throwing it on GitHub.

## Dev Setup

``
gradlew browserDevelopmentRun --continuous
``

then you can just edit the kotlin code and it will auto rebuild and reload

## Licence

no. this code is cursed, don't look at it, don't use it, just use the website.
